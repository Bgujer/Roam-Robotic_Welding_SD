# Roam-Robotic_Welding_SD

## Overview

This repository contains documentation, source code, CAD models, simulation data, and test results for the **ROAM / Rapid Prototyping Lab (RPL) — Robotic Welding Senior Design Project (Fall 2025 – Spring 2026)** at **Colorado State University**.

The goal of this project is to develop a functional robotic welding system integrating a **UFactory xArm 850** with welding hardware and sensing. The system will be capable of performing automated weld paths with repeatability, safety, and process parameter logging.
